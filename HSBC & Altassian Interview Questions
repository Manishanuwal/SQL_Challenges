Problem
Write an SQL query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes.

The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria:

0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than 1000$.
24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range [1000, 10000] inclusive.
49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than 10000$.
Return the result table in any order. Round the salary to the nearest integer.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS salaries;
CREATE TABLE Salaries (
    company_id INT, 
    employee_id INT, 
    employee_name VARCHAR(50), 
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO Salaries (company_id, employee_id, employee_name, salary) VALUES
(1, 1, 'Tony', 2000),
(1, 2, 'Pronub', 21300),
(1, 3, 'Tyrrox', 10800),
(2, 1, 'Pam', 300),
(2, 7, 'Bassem', 450),
(2, 9, 'Hermione', 700),
(3, 7, 'Bocaben', 100),
(3, 2, 'Ognjen', 2200),
(3, 13, 'Nyancat', 3300),
(3, 15, 'Morninngcat', 7777);

**SQL Query** 

with cte as (
select *, max(salary) over(partition by company_id) as max_salary 
from salaries)

select 
	company_id,
	employee_id,
	employee_name,
	salary,
	case when max_salary <1000 then salary 
		when max_salary >=1000 and max_salary<=10000 then salary - 0.24*salary
		else salary - 0.49*salary end as new_salary
from cte;
